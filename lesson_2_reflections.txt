- With git init a new repository gets created with master, whatever it means...
- git status allows me to see that only the repository has been built, but the files are not added yet
_________
- the staging area lets you choose which files from the working directory you want to commit
- it serves as a collection bucket
_________
- the staging area should only hold one file with a logical change when committing
- moreover, you should use the git diff command to check whether you need further commits
- furthermore, use git diff --staged to check that exactly the logical change is committed that you want
