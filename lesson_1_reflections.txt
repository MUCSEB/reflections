- It helps to see bugs, typos and changes much easier
- However, large files will be difficult so check for + and - signs
___________
- The entire history would allow me to go back to any privous version saved
- It would be nice to do this in an automated way and not the primitive way by clicking save as all the time
__________
- pros: you choose the right size of commits, manually add additional commit discriptions
- cons: you can forget it, you can be too lazy, commits can get big
___________
- git tracks programming code form different files -> repositories
- Google Docs saves docs which are probably very unrelated and therefore committed seperately 
___________
- git log loggs all commits with ID and short descriptions
- git diff <commit1> <commit2> compares the commits and lists the changes
- don't forget to switch on colour feature
___________
- git would allow me to do even tricky changes as you can always go back
- addtionally, you can track the changes easily
___________
- I would like to get really into the detaills how to use it for coding
